# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without checking for potential errors, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. It fetches a user from a list based on the provided ID.  However, it fails to handle cases where the `id` parameter is not a valid number, resulting in a potential `NaN` comparison and a failure to find the user even if it exists.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code. This improved version includes error handling to check if the `userId` is a number using `isNaN()` before proceeding. If the `userId` is not a number or no user is found, appropriate error responses are sent.  This makes the route handler more robust and prevents unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` and navigate to `/users/abc` in your browser, or make a request with a non-numeric ID to observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Then, run `node bugSolution.js` and try again to see the improved error handling.
